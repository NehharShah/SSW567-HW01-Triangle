# SSW567-HW01-Triangle

1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 

-> The Challenges that I faced through was to use self.assertEqual and learn more about unittest module for testing.

2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?

-> Perfect and good to understand that every line of code helped me look at the logic indepth.

3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?

-> The challenges I encountered with the unittest were that the self.assertEqual and other function are needed to practices alot to understand software testing functionality.

4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?

-> I used the integers value. Used self.assertEqual to get the value of a, b, c and give them the value and check if they were passing the test cases of equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, Right angle triangles.
